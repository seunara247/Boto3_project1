# ðŸ§  AWS S3 & DynamoDB Python Project

A hands-on Python project that demonstrates how to work with **Amazon S3** and **Amazon DynamoDB** using the `boto3` library.

## ðŸ”Ž Why This Project Is Important

This project gives you practical experience with two widely used AWS services â€” S3 and DynamoDB â€” helping you understand:

- âœ… **Cloud Storage**: How to securely store and share files in the cloud using S3.

- âœ… **Serverless Databases**: How to manage structured data with DynamoDB without managing servers.

- âœ… **Python & AWS Integration**: How to automate cloud operations using Python scripts.

- âœ… **Real-World Skills**: Skills learned here are applicable to cloud engineering, DevOps, backend development, and data storage in modern applications.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

### ðŸ—ƒ S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Creates a new S3 bucket.

- Uploads a file to the bucket.

- Generates a **pre-signed URL** so the file can be accessed without making the bucket public.

### ðŸ“˜ DynamoDB

- Creates a table named `Students`.

- Adds a student record (StudentID, Name, and Email).

- Retrieves and prints that record.

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed

- An AWS account with access credentials configured (`aws configure`)

- The `boto3` package installed:
